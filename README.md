# PA Votes Redesign

This is my final project for ENGL202C. The project is to redesign a document or webpage for a new audience. This website is powered using React and Typescript.

My redesign is for the [PA Voter Registration Application](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/VoterRegistrationApplication.aspx) to make the website more accessible for the public. This is a work in progress.

This redesign will most likely be hosted at https://aquafenaa.dev/pa-votes/ in the future.
However, for now, the site is viewable at http://129.80.72.145:3000/
